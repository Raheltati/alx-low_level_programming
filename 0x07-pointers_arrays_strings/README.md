Pointers and arrays

*A pointer is a variable which contains a memory address.

*In C, an array is NOT a pointer, the variables we declare as arrays do not hold a memory address.

*When we declare an array, we use a name to refer to it, but it is only a name. Array names are identifiers that identify the entire array object. They are not pointers to anything. That is why we can not change the value of a 'variableâ€™ which is an array.
